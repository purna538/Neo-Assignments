##âœ… Unit Testing

- Focuses on individual components or functions of the code.
- Conducted by developers during development.
- Ensures each unit works as intended in isolation.
- Tools: JUnit, NUnit, pytest, etc.

## âœ… Integration Testing

- Verifies interactions between integrated units/modules.
- Detects issues in data flow, interfaces, and communication between components.
- Can be top-down, bottom-up, or hybrid.
- Tools: JUnit, TestNG, Postman (for API), etc.

## âœ… System Testing

- Tests the complete, integrated system as a whole.
- Ensures the software meets specified requirements.
- Involves functional and non-functional testing (e.g., performance, security).
- Typically performed by a QA team.

## âœ… User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

- Performed by end-users or clients.
- Validates that the system meets business needs and requirements.
- Final phase before production deployment.
- Helps catch any business-related issues not identified earlier.
